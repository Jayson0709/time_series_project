    Times Series Project
</h1>
<p id="intro_and_visualization-page-intro">
    This project aims to visualize some dimensionality reduction algorithms used in time-series data analysis. Time-series data usually has high dimensionality and
    we wanted to reduce the dimensionality so that we can extract the key features of the data. Dimensionality reduction also reduces the storage space required for data
    because it helps in data compression and plays a significant role data preprocessing phase.
