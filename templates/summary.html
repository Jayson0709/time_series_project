        <h4>
            OneD_SAX - OneD_Symbolic Aggregate Approximation
        </h4>

        </ul>
        <p>
            Disadvantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Hard to capture segment trend information.
            </li>
            <li>

        </h4>
        <p>
            Features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A sine-cosine basis space is a very familiar concept. It provides a natural framework for optimizations of transform coder design with inputs where the perceptual effects of signal distortion are best understood in the frequency domain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Can provide accurate results.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Disadvantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                 Requires each harmonic to be calculated separately, which requires much more processing power.
            </li>
            <li>
                Does not include location information, only frequency information, and thus has difficulty in representing transients.

        </ul>
        <p>
            Analysis:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Time complexity: <b>O(nlog(n))</b>
            </li>
            <li> Memory requirement: <b>O(n^2)</b>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Disadvantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Takes time to choose a proper wavelet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Computational intensive for fine analysis.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Analysis:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Time complexity: <b>O(n)</b>
            </li>
            <li> Memory requirement: <b>O(n)</b>

        </ul>

        <h4>
            SVD - Singular Value Decomposition
        </h4>
        <p>
            Features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> SVD is typically used on sparse data.
            </li>
            <li>
                SVD is commonly used indirectly to explore the main eigenvalues of a transition matrix,
                estimated from observed trajectories of a certain length.
            </li>
            <li>
                Simplifies data, removes noise, may improve algorithm results.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Disadvantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> SVD of multi-variate time-series is of course very common. SVD cannot meaningfully be directly
                applied to a uni-variate time-series.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transformed data may be difficult to understand.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </ul>

        </h4>
        <p>
            Features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> A raw time series is divided into several segments with unequal lengths based on important points.
            </li>
            <li>
                The observations in each segment are substituted by a mean value.
            </li>
            <li>
                The adaptive piecewise constant approximation is more flexible than the piecewise aggregate approximation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Disadvantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Not as fast as PAA or PLA.
            </li>
        </ul>

            Analysis:
        </p>

            </li>
            <li> Memory requirement: <b>O(n)</b>

        </ul>


        <h4>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Better tightness of lower bound than PAA.
            </li>
            <li>
                PLA possesses small index dimension and low computational overhead.
            </li>
            <li>
                Moreover, this type of representation is more friendly to human visual experience.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Disadvantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Takes time to choose the dividing points and the number of segments.
            </li>
            <li>
                Not suitable for discrete data or sparse data.
